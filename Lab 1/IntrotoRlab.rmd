```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# This lab requires two packages: xtable and pander.  
# Make sure to install each package before running this code chunk.

In this lab we will both practice R syntax/coding and introduce RMarkdown for presenting lab reports.

#### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Task 1: A Basic Simulation Event

Much of our applied probability computing work in this class will be simulating events.  This means that we generate an event at random.  The R function for simulating random numbers is `sample`; check out the help screen.

```{r sample_help}
help(sample)
```

### Code set-up
Let us try simulating a die roll:
The parameter `replace = TRUE` is important here as we are rolling the die over and over again, not drawing marbles out of a bag. Here is how to roll a 6-sided die five times in R, and then compute the average of the rolls.  Try running it!
```{r roll_die}
x = 1:6  # sides of the die
roll = sample(x, 5, replace = TRUE)  # tell R how many sides (x) and how many rolls (5)
mean(roll) # average of the 5 rolls
```

### The problem
A tetrahedron die is a four-sided die with labels {1, 2, 3, 4}.  Have R make 10 rolls of the tetrahedron die and compute the average.  (Can think of this as rolling 10 different tetrahedron dice as well.)
Keep the output in this RMarkdown file for grading purposes.
```{r tetrahedron_roll}
# [Place code here]
x = 1:4  # Sides of the tetrahedron dice
roll = sample(x, 10, replace = TRUE)  # Tell R how many sides (x) and how many rolls (10)
mean(roll)  # Average of the 10 rolls
```

### Question: 

What value do you expect to get for the average of the 10 rolls? 

*2.5*


## Task 2: Playing with for-loops

For-loops are central to the simulation studies we will be performing in this class.  In these experiments, simulation tasks are repeated over and over again.  The for-loop can easily perform this replication for us.  The trick is appropriately storing your results for analysis.  The syntax for a for-loop in R is `for(var in seq){task}`, read "for a given variable in a specified sequence."  The for-loop steps that variable through the sequence and performs the task each time.  

### Code set-up
Let us apply a for-loop for simulating a 6-sided die roll.  That is, repeat 1000 times the experiment of rolling a 6-sided die five times and computing the average.
```{r dieroll_simulation}
S = 1000 # number of simulation experiments performed
# store results in a (1000-dimensional) vector called rolls.avgs
rolls.avgs = vector(length=S)  # setting up the variable rolls.avgs to store the average roll for each experiment
# this for-loop steps the variable simnum through the sequence 1 to 1000,
# repeating 1000 times the die rolling tasks inside the curly brackets {...}.
for(simnum in 1:S){
  # Use our die rolling code from Task 1!
  x = 1:6 # sides of the die
  roll = sample(x, 5, replace = TRUE)  # simulate a die roll
  rolls.avgs[simnum] = mean(roll) # store the average roll
}
# take a look at the first 6 simulation results
head(rolls.avgs)
# compute the mean of the 1000 experiments
mean(rolls.avgs)
```

### The problem
Repeat 1000 times the experiment you performed in Task 1, that is rolling a tetrahedron die 10 times and computing the average.  Report the average and standard deviation of the 1000 experiments.  The standard deviation function in R is `sd(x)`.

```{r tetrahedron_simulation}
# [Place code here]
S = 1000
rolls.avgs = vector(length = S)
for(simnum in 1:S){
  x = 1:4
  roll = sample(x, 10, replace = TRUE)
  rolls.avgs[simnum] = mean(roll)
}
head(rolls.avgs)
mean(rolls.avgs)
sd(rolls.avgs)
```

### Questions: 

* Is the mean closer to the value you would expect than the average you had in Task 1?  Why? 

*Yes, because we roll 10 times so we have more data sets*

* How do you interpret the standard deviation in this problem? 

*The difference between each experiment and the mean value*


## Task 3: Presenting tables in RMarkdown

Let us present a table of our die rolls.  We will use `xtable` and `pander` R packages.  Make sure to install the `pander` package prior to running the code chunk.  In this task, we will also try the `replicate()` function in R to replace the for-loop.

Have R make 5 rolls of the tetrahedron die and repeat that 4 times.  Present the results in a table.

#### R Markdown
The exact code is provided for you below.  In this way you can cut-and-paste this code for table-making in future labs.
Three parameters were added to the code chunk:
The `echo = FALSE` parameter was addedto prevent printing of the R code that generated the table.
The `results='asis'` parameter was added to have R present the results as is for the table generation.
The `warning=FALSE` parameter suppresses warning messages from R that are often presented when loading packages.

As an aside, a fourth common parameter is `include=FALSE`, which prevents R from printing output when running the code chunk.

```{r xtable, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning=FALSE}
library(xtable)
library(pander)
dierolls = replicate(4, sample(x, 5, replace=TRUE))  # five tetrahedron die rolls
colnames(dierolls) = cbind("Replicate 1", "Replicate 2", "Replicate 3", "Replicate 4")  # label the table columns
# xtable creates the table in RMarkdown
# align tells xtable how to justify the columns (left (l), right (r), or center (c));
#    here also place vertical lines on left and right of table, and after first column of var names 
lab.table = xtable(dierolls, align = "|l|rrrr|", caption="Replicate 5 rolls of a tetrahedron die two times.")
# pander outputs a nice table in RMarkdown (I like it better than the xtable output!)
pander(lab.table)
```

### Question:

What do you observe across the replicates?

*Rows are completely random but they can be duplicated.*



## Task 4: Presenting graphs in RMarkdown

Graphs are easy to display in an RMarkdown file.  

### Code set-up
Let us draw a histogram of our 1000 die rolls from earlier.

```{r histogram, echo=TRUE}
hist(rolls.avgs, main="", xlab="Average of set of 10 rolls")
```

### The problem
Let us add a normal approximation (bell curve) to the histogram.  We will cover the normal distribution later in the course.  But hopefully you recall it from your Statistics course!
To add a density curve to the plot, need to change the y-axis to a 'density' scale.  This is done by setting the parameter `prob = TRUE`.  The `curve` function addes a curve to the plot.  We will use a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation set at the values obtained in Task 2.  Here is the code

  hist(rolls.avgs, prob = T, main="", xlab="Average of set of 10 rolls")  # histogram
  
  curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(rolls.avgs), sd=sd(rolls.avgs)), add=TRUE, col="green")  # normal approximation
  
Add these to the code chunk to present a histogram with a normal approximation
```{r histogram_dens, echo=TRUE}
# [Place code here]
hist(rolls.avgs, prob = TRUE, main = "", xlab = "Average of set of 10 rolls") # Histogram of rolls.avgs
curve(dnorm(x, mean = mean(rolls.avgs), sd = sd(rolls.avgs)), add = TRUE, col = "green") # Normal approximation
```

### Questions: 

* Interpret the histogram--shape, skew, spread, center. 

*The histogram has normal curve (bell shape).*


* Does this follow what you would expect to see? 

*Yes because every side has equal chance of being rolled so it should be a nice normal curve.*



## Task 5: Boolean expressions

Another useful task is making logical statements in R.

### Code set-up
Let us first make 10 rolls of a die and see how often a 6 is rolled.
```{r roll_a_6, echo=TRUE}
x = 1:6  # 6-sided die
rolls = sample(x, 10, replace = TRUE)  # roll the die ten times
# Boolean expression: how often is the roll EXACTLY 6, use double-equals sign
sum(rolls == 6) 
```

Now repeat 1000 times the experiment of rolling a die 10 times as in Task 2.  We will see how many times a six occurs at least once out of ten rolls across all these experiments.  The code for this counting exercise is `sum(roll==6)>0` since a "success" is an experiment where the total number of sixes showing on ten rolls is more than zero!

```{r num_sixes}
six = 0 # start a counter for number of times at least one six shows in 5 rolls
S = 1000 # number of experiments
# for-loop to repeat die rolling experiment 1000 times
for(simnum in 1:S){
  x = 1:6 # 6-sided die
	roll = sample(x, 10, replace = TRUE) # roll the die ten times
	# two ways to count: with an if-then statement, or more elegantly with a Boolean computation
	#if(sum(roll==2) > 0){st = st + 1}  # if-then statement
	six = six + (sum(roll==6)>0)  # Boolean computation: add one to the counter only if at least one 6 shows.
}
six
```

### The problems

#### First problem

How often in 5 rolls of a tetrahedron die is a two rolled?

```{r roll_a_2, echo=TRUE}
# [Place code here]
x = 1:4  # 4-sided die
rolls = sample(x, 5, replace = TRUE)  # roll the die five times
sum(rolls == 2)
```

### Questions:

* Run the code multiple times.  What values do you get?

*I was getting very random values from 0 to 4.*


* Are the values different?  Is that what you expect?

*Yes, they are random values, but they can be duplicated.*


#### Second problem

This is heading towards a probability calculation.  Roll the tetrahedron die 5 times and repeat this experiment 1000 times as in Task 2.  Report the *proportion* of 1000 simulations where a two occurred.
(This derives from Dobrow problem 1.44: Probability of rolling at least one 2 in five rolls of a tetrahedron die.)

##### Dobrow problem 1.30: Exact answer is 0.7627

```{r prob}
# [Place code here]
two = 0 # Counter for number of times at least one five shows in 5 rolls
S = 1000
for(simnum in 1:S){
  x = 1:4  # Tetrahedron die
  roll = sample(x, 5, replace = TRUE) # Roll the die 5 times
  two = two + (sum(roll == 2) > 0) 
}
two
two / S  # Proportion of 1000 simulations where a two occurred
```

### Questions:

* Is the value you get close to the truth (0.7627)?

*Yes, it is.*



* How can we modify the simulation experiement to get a value even close to the truth?

*We can increase the number of experiments (value of S) to get a value even closer to the truth.*



## Task 6: Finalize your output for submitting to Blackboard

As we noted, you can run each code chunk using the "play" button on the top right corner of the chunk.
You may also run individual lines of code in the RStudio console for debugging purposes.

To run the whole document and preview the Word document, press the "Knit" button in the menu bar underneath the tabs.  This should present a preview of the Word file and save a .docx file in your working directory.

Alternatively, you may render the Word file in the R console using the `render` command.  

* Save your file as a .rmd file to your desired working directory.  

* Then in the R console, place the following:

       library(rmarkdown)

       render("filename.rmd")

This will save the .docx file of the report to your working directory.
